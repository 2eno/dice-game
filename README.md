# Multiplayer dice game

Hey there! This is my first public repo and a playground for React Native. I didn't want to litter the net with yet another Todo List app and decided to go with a simple game instead.

Developing a dice game was actually a programming task for a tech startup. The following are the original requirements:

- First user in the system selects the number of dice to roll (1-4)
- The game can begin when there are at least 2 users online
- They roll the dice (by clicking the button)
- The one with the greatest score wins
- If they want they can play again
- Dice are 6 sided (1-6)
- When one player rolls the dice others have up to 5 seconds to respond, otherwise they will lose
- The game is not limited to 2 players
- Backend: Python or Node
- Frontend: preferred: React.js + Redux, but you can use AngularJS too
 
Instead of hacking something together in a few hours I decided to go that extra mile and do a proper graphical design + go with React Native instead of a Web App.
